# Wave Venture Challenge
We ask that candidates attempt a programming challenge to get an idea of their aptitude and programming style (included below). We encourage you to attempt this challenge, even if aspects of it are new to you or are not immediately obvious how to approach.

## Specification
Within this zip, you'll find a file named `sample_challenge_data.json`. It is a json file with some geometry data. There are two keys in the data, `p` & `q`. `p` is a list of points in 3d space. `q` is a list of quadrilaterals, each quadrilateral is a list of 4 indices into the list of points.

Part of the surface is dry (`z > 0`) and part is wet (`z < 0`). We want to create 2 new files, of the same format. One to represent the dry geometry, and one to represent the wet geometry. The challenge is to produce a small code base doing this. 

You are free to use whatever programming language you feel will best demonstrate your abilities. 

The code base should resemble a small project structure, with the appropriate bells and whistles of a well maintained project (maybe some documentation on how to run the code, for example).

## Timeline
It should be less than 3-4 hours work. The deadline on submission is 1 calendar week (7 days) on receipt of the email containing this challenge. 

We aim to review these within 1-2 weeks. Though, Wave Venture is a small company so these can fall to the side in busy periods. If you do not hear back, please do chase us up by email.

## Submission
Please do not publicly host your project on GitHub (or the like), as we use this challenge for new recruits and do not want the solutions to be easily copied.

To submit, please simply zip your project and send it via email (to the contact below). If, for some reason, the zip is larger then what can be sent over email, then please privately host the zip on somewhere like Dropbox/Google Drive etc. and email a private download link.

In your zip, make sure to remove machine-dependant things, such as virtual environments etc (things you'd normally exclude in a `.gitignore`), but do keep any source control metadata, such as `.git` folders.

## Contact
If you have any questions, concerns, etc., and to submit your challenge, please email them to james@wave-venture.com.
